# MLB At a Glance

This is a small project thrown together to practice pulling information from a third party API as well as using CSS to dynamically change the information presented on the page according to the data received.

This application does not use ActiveRecord or a database as all of the information is pulled from the MLB Stats API. This does mean that performance/speed is dependent upon the API requests (which can sometimes be slow).

Something I would like to do is find a better way to update the information live instead of refreshing the page and pulling the information on page load.
